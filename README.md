# Alexa-Skill-Development
My first project on alexa skill development 

#What is this project?
Okay so, this is the voice based subdomain finder script which runs on alexa device.

#What is does?
1. Verify whether the given input URL actually exist or not?
2. Performs the subdomain enumeration based on given voice input.
3. Scans and email the results on given email address.

#Limitations
- As of now it only supports https urls which are on .com domain. (Soon i will upload the fix for that issue)
